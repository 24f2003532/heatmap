# Supply Chain Correlation Analysis

This repository contains a correlation analysis and visualization of a supply chain dataset using Microsoft Excel.

## Files

- `correlation.csv` – Correlation matrix of the main numerical supply chain variables.
- `heatmap.png` – Screenshot of the Excel correlation matrix with Red–White–Green conditional formatting.
- `README.md` – Project description and contact information.

## Dataset Description

The analysis is based on a supply chain dataset with the following columns:

1. `Supplier_Lead_Time`
2. `Inventory_Levels`
3. `Order_Frequency`
4. `Delivery_Performance`
5. `Cost_Per_Unit`

These numeric columns are used to compute the correlation matrix.

## Analysis Steps (Summary)

1. Enabled the **Analysis ToolPak** in Excel.
2. Used **Data → Data Analysis → Correlation** to generate a correlation matrix for the 5 columns.
3. Copied the correlation matrix to a new worksheet.
4. Applied **Conditional Formatting → Color Scales → Red–White–Green** to visualize correlations.
5. Exported the correlation matrix as `correlation.csv`.
6. Captured the conditional formatting as `heatmap.png` (400x400 to 512x512 pixels).
